This application is a Random Meal Generator :pizza: from the [App Ideas Collection :ledger:](https://github.com/florinpop17/app-ideas/blob/master/Projects/1-Beginner/Random-Meal-Generator.md).

It solves the following user stories:

* User can click a button that will get a random meal from an external API
* The app should display: Recipe name, Ingredients, Instructions and a Picture of the meal
* By clicking the button again, another meal will be generated
* The app should display a YouTube Video

For this project I used React, Material UI, and Axios. It was a cool project, simple, quick and I enjoyed learning the fundamentals of the technologies.

If you want to run this application on your machine you'll need:

* **[Install Node/NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/)**
* **Run the application using npm start**
